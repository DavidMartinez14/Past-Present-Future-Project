<h1>David's Past,Present,and Future</h1>


<h2>My past</h2>

<p>I was born on Dominican Republic,Santo Domingo.I was born at 12:00 am.Ever since I was born I lived on the same house for 11 years, The house is placed on the capital of Santo Domingo  in a street called the Quiskeya, i lived there for 11 years, just when i was 11 we moved to another house and lived in that house for at least 2 or 1/2 years and then we moved to the united states. After many months we finally got a house for us, and that's pretty much it that's my past.Look at this website, it has resorts and hotels that you can rent if you plan to visit one of the best contries on the caribean.<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g147293-Punta_Cana_La_Altagracia_Province_Dominican_Republic-Hotels.html">Resorts in Dominican republic</a></p>

<p>My dad is a pastor, and my mom doesn't really work, my brother helps my dad on church stuff but he doesn't gain money from it, At the moment i'm the only one at school, my sister graduated from highschool, and brother is going to college probably next year, i can't say i'm alone because to be honest i think i'm better off without them.</p>
